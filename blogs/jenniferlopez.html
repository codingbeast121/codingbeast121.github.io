                        Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, famously known as "Bennifer," have officially ended their marriage after two years. On August 20, 2024, Lopez filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court, marking the end of a relationship that captivated fans across the globe. The filing listed April 26, 2024, as the date of their separation, and multiple reports suggest that Lopez took this step after months of speculation and separation from Affleck.

                        <br>
                        The couple's love story dates back more than 20 years. Lopez and Affleck originally got together in 2002, becoming one of Hollywood's most high-profile couples. After postponing their 2003 wedding, they eventually called it quits in 2004. However, in 2021, the pair rekindled their romance, leading to their surprise Las Vegas wedding in July 2022, followed by a more lavish celebration in Georgia a month later.

                        This reunion was seen as a fairy-tale comeback by many, but behind the scenes, challenges persisted. Reports indicate that cracks began to show earlier this year, as rumors of their strained relationship circulated, especially after Affleckâ€™s absence from major public events like the Met Gala in May 2024.

                        <br>
                        According to sources, Lopez was "heartbroken" but felt she had no choice but to move forward. She reportedly tried her best to keep the relationship intact, but Affleck's lack of commitment to fixing things led to her decision. Their relationship became increasingly distant, with the two spending more time apart, and Lopez ultimately prioritized her children and personal well-being.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lopez filed the divorce papers herself, choosing not to involve a lawyer and representing herself instead. The timing of the filing is notable as it coincides with the second anniversary of their formal wedding ceremony in Georgia, a bittersweet milestone that now marks the end of their marriage.

                        <br>
                        For Lopez, this divorce marks her fourth time ending a marriage. Her previous marriages include relationships with Ojani Noa, Cris Judd, and Marc Anthony, with whom she shares twins, Max and Emme. Affleck, who was previously married to Jennifer Garner, has three children from that relationship. Both stars are now focusing on their families as they navigate this new chapter.

                        While the end of Bennifer 2.0 is undoubtedly disappointing for fans, Lopez seems determined to move forward. As the entertainment world watches closely, only time will tell what the future holds for these two Hollywood icons.

Whether it's career demands, family dynamics, or simply growing apart, celebrity couples are no different from anyone else when it comes to love and heartbreak.</strong>
