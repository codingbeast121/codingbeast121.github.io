                        <strong class="sttxt">On August 15, 2024, </strong>the hip-hop community mourned the unexpected passing of Houston rapper and producer Justin Riley, better known as BeatKing, at the age of 39. Known by his fans as Club Godzilla, BeatKing was a defining force in Southern rap, particularly in Texas, where his bold and energetic tracks became staples in clubs and college parties.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h1 class="inttitle intelem">A Rise from the Underground</h1>

                        <br>
                        BeatKing first made a name for himself in Houston's underground scene during the early 2010s, gradually becoming a cornerstone of the local party scene with tracks that balanced humor, raunchiness, and infectious beats. His breakout single, “Then Leave,” which went viral in 2020, propelled him into the mainstream. The song’s catchy hook and signature high-energy style resonated not just in Texas but across the globe, particularly on platforms like TikTok.
<br><br>
Throughout his career, BeatKing stayed true to his roots, producing hit after hit while collaborating with industry heavyweights like 2 Chainz, Juicy J, and Ludacris. Despite his growing success, he remained a key figure in Houston, representing his city with pride and continually pushing the boundaries of club music.
