                        <strong class="sttxt">• Coding/Programming : </strong>is just a way to communicate with computer. We command computer to do tasks through the codes and the computer does the task we have commanded it to do so.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Coding</strong> word has came from the word "Code" and <strong class="sttxt">Programming</strong> word has came from the word "Program" meanwhile coding and programming both are same except the literal meaning. When we writing codes then it is said to be Coding and when we making a program through codes then it is said to be Programming.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Program </strong>is sets of codes that does particular task. Programs are made through codes that can do the tasks according to the codes such as we can write codes that gives us a multiplication table of any number then this is called a Program that gives us a multiplication table of a number.

                        <br>
                        <img src="/blogs/bimg/howcodingworks.jpg" class="intimg intelem" alt="ai">
                        <br>
                        Now let's take a deep look how actually coding works, how we command computers to do particular task through our codes and how they do task. Let's dive in it and know!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Binary Numbers </strong> - are the only thing that computer understands, computer neither understands any other number, any sign nor any english letter or any character. binary numbers are 0 and 1 number through which computers works and performs various tasks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then how to communicate with computer if it understands only binary numbers? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Binary numbers are complicated numbers that human brain can't understand easily. For example if we want to write a word "Hi" in binary numbers then we will have to write "01001000 01101001" now just like that if we have to command computer to do any task like "print(Hi)" then we will have to convert each character of "print(Hi)" in binary number and give it to the computer so that computer can understand it and print "Hi".
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But is it easy? Absolutely Not! we will have to write millions of numbers according to tasks that we want to command the computer to do which is absolutely hard.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then what's the solution of it? This is where <b>Programming Languages</b> helps.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="topictitle">What Are Programming Languages ?</h2>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Programming Languages </strong> - are computer languages used to communicate to a computer. They provide a structured way to write code that computers can understand, execute and perform tasks. Different programming languages have different syntax and semantics.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">How Programming Languages Solved The Issue Of Binary Numbers</strong> - Basically instead of writing thousands of binary numbers in order to communicate with computer, we use programming languages to communicate with computer as with the help of programming language we type the codes in english letters that we can easily understand so we don't have to worry about binary numbers anymore.
                        <br>
                        But if computer doesn't understands english characters as well then how computer is going to understand english codes written through programming languages?
                        <br>
                        For this problem we have Interpreter/Compiler.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="topictitle">Interpreter/Compiler</h2>
                        <br>
                        <img src="/blogs/bimg/intercomp.jpg" class="intimg intelem" alt="ai">
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Interpreter/Compiler </strong> - both does a same task but works in different way. Interpreter/Compiler directly executes instructions written in a programming language without the need for prior conversion. They translates code into computer/machine language/code and executes it immediately.
                        <br>
                        Basically Interpreter/compiler converts each of our code character by character into binary numbers and give it to the computer so that computer understands it and then performs the task that we commanded it to do through our codes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Interpreter </strong> - executes the codes line by line and executes it immediately. Interpreters are often used in scripting languages like Python or JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">Compiler </strong> - A compiler, on the other hand, translates entire programs written in a programming language into machine code or another language before execution. This process typically involves several steps: lexical analysis (breaking code into tokens), syntax analysis (checking for correct syntax), semantic analysis (ensuring logical correctness), and code generation (producing machine-readable code). Compiled languages include C, C++, and Java.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">In summary :-</strong>
                        <br>
                        Interpreter: Executes code line by line, translating and executing on the fly. 
                        <br>
                        Compiler: Translates entire programs into machine code or another form before execution.

                        <br>
                        <strong class="sttxt">How To Start Coding</strong> - After knowing all about coding, it's time to see how to start coding.
                        <br>
                        To start coding you need to first understand what is coding, how it works, what are it's uses and you have already understand these things so how you can start coding now?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To enter the field of coding you have to start with learning a programming language that makes you understand what actually you have to do coding, how you have to write codes, how codes and programs works and so on that you will be learnt by yourself gradually during the time of learning a programming language.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So with which language you should start?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my and in most of the people's opinion, one should start with <b>Python Programming Language</b> as it's best for beginners to understand various stuffs. Python has easy and decent syntax that one can understand easily so if you are a beginner and you are going to learn your first language then you should start with <b>Python</b>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can start with other langugages as well like C, C++ or Java but these languages are bit harder than Python so you can choose accordingly with what you want to start.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After learning any programming language now you have a good idea of how coding and all works so now you have to choose in what field you want to get into, either App Development, Web developmetn, Hacking or something else. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After choosing a field you just have to learn stuffs according to your field and <strong class="sttxt">All Set!</strong>
                        <br>
