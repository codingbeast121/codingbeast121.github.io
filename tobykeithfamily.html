Speaking ahead of the Toby Keith: American Icon tribute concert, the family revealed that they are still grappling with the loss. "You don’t get over it.

                        As the Keith family continues to navigate life without their beloved patriarch, they find solace in the memories they cherish and the legacy he left behind.
